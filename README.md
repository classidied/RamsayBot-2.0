# Ramsay Bot - The Best Gordon Ramsay-themed Discord Bot.
(work in progress aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
With prefix `~`, Ramsay Bot is readied to cure or deepen your depression at your beck and will. Now that he is a bot, he will always be with you. You cannot escape. 

## Commands
Including commands:
- `insult` (self explanatory)
- `encourage` (pretend someone cares about you!)
- `recipe [optional keyword]` (sends you a random Gordon Ramsay recipe w/o a keyword, or 1-3 relevant ones based on the keyword)
- `alarm <@member>` (wake up your friends!)
- `idiot <@member>` (image generation: idiot sandwich meme)
- `finally <@member1>` (up to 2 mentions, finally some good food meme)
- `finally [message]` (finally some good food meme format 2)
- `help` (displays the help page)
- `userinfo` (displays userinfo)
  
As well as non-controllable functions:
  - there are multiple different words that when typed, will invoke Gordon Ramsay himself to personally send his favorite photos of himself to the server (bruh, sausage, eat, lamb)
  - Ramsay is known as nothing else than the world's greatest samaritian, a saint among Jesus himself, thus it is only fitting that he protects all the young, unfortunate souls who fall for obscenely overused jokes ("who's joe")
